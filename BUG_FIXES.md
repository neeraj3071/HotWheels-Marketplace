# Bug Fixes and New Features

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Messages Page Error - "threads.map is not a function"
**Issue:** The app was crashing when trying to display the messages page.
**Fix:** Added array validation in `fetchThreads()` to ensure the response is always an array.
**Location:** `frontend/src/app/messages/page.tsx`

### 2. Price Display Showing $NaN
**Issue:** Listing prices were showing as $NaN on the browse page.
**Fix:** Changed from `listing.price` to `listing.priceCents` to match the backend data structure.
**Location:** `frontend/src/app/listings/page.tsx` (line 217)

### 3. Wishlist 404 Error  
**Issue:** Adding items to wishlist was failing with a 404 error.
**Fix:** Created the complete wishlist backend module that was missing:
- Created `backend/src/modules/wishlist/schemas.ts` (validation schemas)
- Created `backend/src/modules/wishlist/service.ts` (business logic)
- Created `backend/src/modules/wishlist/router.ts` (API endpoints)
- Added wishlist router to main API routes

**New Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/wishlist` - Add item to wishlist
- `GET /api/wishlist` - Get user's wishlist
- `DELETE /api/wishlist/:id` - Remove from wishlist

## New Features

### 4. Admin Dashboard
**Feature:** Complete admin panel for platform management.
**Location:** `frontend/src/app/admin/page.tsx`

**Capabilities:**
- View system statistics (total users, listings, messages)
- User management with role assignment (USER â†” ADMIN)
- Listing moderation and deletion
- Real-time data display

**Access:** Only visible to users with ADMIN role

### 5. Admin Link in Navigation
**Feature:** Added "Admin Panel" link to user dropdown menu (only visible to admins).
**Location:** `frontend/src/components/Header.tsx`

### 6. Image Upload Component
**Feature:** New file-based image upload system replacing URL input.
**Location:** `frontend/src/components/ImageUpload.tsx`

**Features:**
- Upload multiple images from device (up to 10)

- Remove individual images
- Drag-and-drop ready (can be enhanced)
